This study investigates a cell-free massive MIMO system integrated with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), focusing on performance under imperfect channel estimation and pilot contamination. Proposes a heterogeneous graph neural network (HetGNN) architecture to optimize the RIS-assisted CFMM system for maximizing performance.
